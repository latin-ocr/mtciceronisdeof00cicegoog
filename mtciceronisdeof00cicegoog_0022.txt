περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος, because καθῆκον signifies what is ‘suitable’
‘becoming’ Cicero replies to him⁸: non dubitoquin καθῆκονιῃῇ- “
ci um sit nasi quidtu aliud, sed inscriptzhplmmr dc officiis: and in
another letter⁹ milri non cst dubium, quin, quod Graeci καθῆκον,
nos effi ci um,· t'd aufem qut'd dubitas quin etiam in remp. praeclare
quadret? nonne dicimus consulum officium, senatus officium,

i inperatoris officium? praeclare convenit, aut da multas.

Cicero resolved to dedicate the work to his son Marcus¹⁰. 4
Marcus Cicero was born atie. 689, ac. 65¹¹. His father
watched over his education with the greatest care, had¹ him
taught by the best masters? and wrote for his especial instruc·
tion the de pam‘tmne oratoria dialogus. In the civil war
Marcus, then a youth' of seventeen, joined the army of
Pompey, from whom he received the command of a squadron .
of cavalry, probably only nominally, but to the satisfaction of
his general¹³. After the battle of Pharsalia (nc. 45), he was
desirous of proceeding to Spain and taking part in the service
of Caesar against his former friends. He was, however, in-
duced by his father to abandon this project¹⁴, and sent to
Athens to prosecute his studies along with several other young
Romans of distinguished family. Here, although provided
with aliberal allowance¹⁶, he fell into extravagant habits, but
soon reformed his mode of life and became diligent in his Ι
application to philosophy under Cratippus of Mitylene, who ’
was at that time head of the Peripatetic School¹⁶. After the
death of Caesar, he was raised to the rank of military tribune
by Brutus, and did much good service in the course of the
Macedonian campaign. T he attainder pronounced upon his
father was extended to him also, without the T riumvirs, how-
ever, being able to injure him. When his party was broken
up by the rout at Philippi, he joined Sextus Pompeius in
Sicily and taking advantage of the amnesty in favour of exiles,

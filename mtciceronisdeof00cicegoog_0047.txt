xl Introduction

denee which is really opposed to truth, and with the viola-
tion of justice for the sake of profit. But as each neglect
of virtue is based upon a misconception of true expediency
and therefore upon false prudence, the several examples (and
the whole essay consists in examples) cannot be kept dis-
tinct (ἓ 96). So also with the examples which follow. Not
but that in *the First Book also the connexion of thought
is frequently defective (5 117), and certain common-place
sentiments are repeated so as to interrupt the general tenour
of the discourse (ἐξ 68, 80). His proofs frequently contain
irrelevant matter (1§§153, 157) and the examples which he
adduces are sometimes such as bearno relation to the question
under discussion (1 §3⁶2 111 ᾗ 112). Again previous classifica-
tions and definitions are not sufficiently regarded in his treat- ·
ment of the subject to which they belong.

40 His diction also exhibits marks of haste, which is not sur-
pri'sing considering the circumstances under which the work .
was composed: he indulges in tedious prolixity in several
places (e. g. 1 § 14, 11 ἓξ 22, 56, 111 ἓ 117), while at other
times we are led to admire his variety of description and skill

ment that virtue alone is expedient is throughout kept in view(
After a brief introduction on the subject of his work (c. 1)
and a few remarks on duty in general, he states the division
of his subject which he proposes to make, ξ 9. Accordingly the
First Book (c. 3-43) is taken up with the consideration of
the duties arising from virtue, c. 43-45 with a comprehensive
estimate of the several virtues and their conflict one with
another, in c.4 and c, 5 the different kinds of morality are

specified, then follow the duties that arise from wisdom c. 6,
next those which are necessary for the maintenanee of human
society c 7-18, those imposed upon us by fortitude c. 18-236‚
42 and lastly those of temperance 1 17-41, The Second Book
treats of the duties which expediency imposes on us. By way
of introduction cc.1and 2 Cicero premises a vindication of
the study of philosophy and of the Academic system. Upon

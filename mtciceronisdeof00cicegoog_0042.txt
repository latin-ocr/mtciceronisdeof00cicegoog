Stoicos nen ut interpretes, sed-e fontibus eorum tiede‘eia arbitrio
que nostre, quantum quaque maele videbitur, haurrimuffl, as well
as by the opinions of the ancients‚ who speak of the book in
terms of the highest praise³⁶. It is true, the very parts which 32
Cicero himself professes in several places to be additions os
his own³⁷ on the superiority of particular virtues and particular
kinds of expedieney are either merely indicated, not fully
discussed, as 11 c. 25, or they are supported by the argu-
ments of the Stoics‚ as the question about the preference
of a life of practical or theoretical activity considered in
1c. 4 3, which formed the principal point of conflict between the
Stoics and Peripatetics. His alterations of their scientific
system amount to few, except that in all cases he shews an·
'evident desire to modify and mitigate the Stoic rigour, and dis-
criminates between theory and practice in a manner eminently
characteristic of himself“⁸. Itis of very little consequence that
he substitutes magnitude anr’eni for the ἀνδρεία of the Stoics‚
and makes fortitude subordinate to it, while the Stoics mostly
do the reverse„ Moreover his calling ‘moral good' honestum,
while the Greeks call it καλόν, is characteristic enough of the
difference between the Greek and Roman point of view, but no
corresponding new idea is conveyed with the change of term.
We must not however sorget, that while the Greeks defined
the notion of καλὸν objectively, Cicero dwells more upon the
consideration that the honestum has or merits the applause of
right-minded men; this accounts for his attributing a higher
value to glory than the Stoics did⁸⁹. Similarly he assigns a33
signification to the ‘becoming' (decorum), which it does not
bear with the Stoics. For while they profess a disregard sor
form and external demeanour in comparisonwithavirtuous dis-
position, Cicero will have it that virtue should have a pleasing
exterior and not bc opposed to the manners and customs of

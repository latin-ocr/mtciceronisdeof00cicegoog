xxx Introduction

2 as the desire after society and so the fulfilnrent of the
only conditions ou which this society can be maintained,

3 as the desire for pre-emineuce,

4 as the desire to control the passions and preserve dig·
nity and sels-respect‘l Thus the Stoicsarrive at the four
cardinal Virtues of Plato, which, according to their theory that
knowledge lies at the bottom of all virtue, they defined as
follows: Prudence as the knowledge of good and evil and inter·
mediate things, ¹Discretion (σωφροσύνη) as the knowledge of
what ought to be chosen and what rejected, Justice, as the
knowledge of the value which is to be assigned to each thing,
Courage as the knowledge of what is to be feared and what
not. Still in these definitions individual members of the Porch
were notall agreed⁰¹.

25 Of these four cardinal Virtues there are further subdivisions
which are given differently by different Stoics: they are to be
discussed' rn the first book

Our modern division of duties into duty towards God,
duty towards our neighbour and towards ourselves, was un· ·
known¹ to the Stoics, for with them each duty is a duty
towards the deity, and therefore every transgression an offence

iustitia et omnis honestas perfecte absoluta est. The distinction however
between the individual virtues is not so strongly marked in this passage as
in Stobaeus ecl. eth. p. 108, who first lays it down as the aim of all virtue
ἀκολούθως τῇ φύσει ζῆν and then adds that men have from Nature ἀφορμὰς

5 11⁸. liam quod Herculem Prodicus mett] l'or as to the story told oi

Hercules by Prodicus, bis case was different from ours: he was the son of
Jupiter, we are but ordinary mortals. On this use of nam see u. to 11547.
Some read Herodem Prodr'cium ‘the Hercules os Prodicus,’ ie. such as heis
represented by Prodictu. So Hercules Xenophontem epist. ad fam. v ra,
Terentianus Phormio pro Caecin 5 27, T erentrhnus Chremes above 5 30,
senex Caecilianus pro Rosc. Amet· 546. For notioes os Prodicus in
ancient writers see my Onomast. Amittoph. p. 915 sq. The substance of
his lecture as given by Xenophon in the well-known ‘Choice of Hercules'
was this: “When Hercules, entering upon manhood was on the point ol
choosiug between virtue and vice, two women appeared tobim, theone oi
dignified beauty, purity, modesty, and discretim, the other os a voluptuous
form and meretricious look and dress. The latter promised to lead him
by the shonest road, without any toil, to the enjoyment of every pleasure.
'ibe other, while she reminded him of his ancestors and his noble nature, ⁴
did not conceal from him that the gods have granted nothing really
beautiful and good without toil and pleasnre. Hercules decided in favour
os virtue. The e isode has been paraphrased in English verse by Shen·
stone. and by Bishop Louth, and there is a prose translation ot* it in the
‘Tatler' No. 97. Allusions to it are frequent in classicul writers, eg. Sil.
Ital. Punic. xv 18—127, Luciau Somn. c. 6, Deor· dialog. xx rr, ller-
metimus c. a 5.

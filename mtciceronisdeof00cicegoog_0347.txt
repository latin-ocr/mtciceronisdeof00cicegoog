5 14, 1 4. aerarii unaarum] ‘the impoverished state of the exchequer!

1. tt. tributum] ‘a property tax‚' being a percentage levied upon the
fortune of each Roman citizen, as rated hythe censors: its proceeds were
chiefly applied to provide for the expenses of war (Liv. ιν 60, v 10, Vl 3²)-
There had been no occasion to levy a tributum since the subjugation of
Macedonia by Paullus Aemilius Β. c. 167, by which the treasury was well
replenished (5 76 l. 4). All tolls also (pomaria) had been discontinued
since Pompey's victory over Mithridates rac. 60, according to the pro·
visions of the Lex Caecilia enacted by Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos.
Cicero’s presage, that there might be an occasion for renewing these burdens
upon the citizens, was fulfilled in the year following, Β. c. 43, when a war
tax was laid upon the people, the treasury having been impoverished by
the frequent demands made upon it by Caesar and Antony, Sueton. Caesar

ad fam. 111 ιο pro tua dignitate, mala enim ita dicere quam pro salute,
ad Att. 1111142, 1 cur pateris-malo enim ita dicere quam cur committis.
Madvig thinks ita or sic required in the former, Wesenberg reads ita in
the latter of the passages quoted. Translate: ‘I had rather say so than
forebode evils to our own commonwealth.' Observe that the first part of
the parenthesis-malo enim ita quam nostraecminari-—refers to alicui rcip.;
in the second part he recalls the words which he has just uttered, as un·
called for, because he is speaking of the state in general and not of any state
in particular.

nequa tamen] i.e. quamquam non, though this remark is not neces·

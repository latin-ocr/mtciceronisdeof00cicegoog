xvi Introduction

which was part of the convention between that chief and the
triumvirs, returned to Rome. Here he lived in retirement until
Octavianus assumed him as his colleague in the Consulship
after Sept· 13 uc. 30. Soon after the termination of his office,
he was made Proconsul of Asia¹⁷. Of his later life we know
nothing. He possessed none of the high qualities which
marked his father’s character, his ambition, his energy, appli-
cation and sels-denial,-one of the principal reasons, doubtless,
why Cicero dedicated to him an essay on Duties. The im-
pressive admonitions which the father addresses to his son
(1 ξ 3, ηιξ 5 §6 and ᾗ 121) prove that he was not altogether
satisfied with his conduct, as is further shewn by some of his
letters to Atticus¹⁸ concerning him.

5 Cicero is too much of a Roman not to give a decided pre·
ference to a life of practical activity over that of the mere
student, and the study of philosophy with him only served as
an introduction to the profession of an orator. Whilst fully
recognising the sublime enjoyment arising from the pursuit of
knowledge¹⁹‚ he maintains at the same time that man's natural
inclination is rather to a life of public activity than of study,
for knowledge is defective and incomplete unless it be made
to serve some useful end²⁰. The aim of all Philosophy is with
him to ascertain the right method of action and the conditions
of a happy life. He bestows especial praise therefore upon
Socrates, because he was the first to divert the study of philosophy
from occupying itself with questions of physics into its right
channel²¹, the domain of ethics3 and in his own philosophical
writings Logic and Physics are represented as inferior to
Ethics and considered only so far as they have any practical
bearing, the former as the groundwork of all philosophy and
as especially important for the orator, the latter as a necessary

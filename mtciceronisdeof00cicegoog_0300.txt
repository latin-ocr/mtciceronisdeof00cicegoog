quoque dignissima est, de fin. 1 ἓ 2 philosophiae quidem vituperatoribus
'satis responsum est eo libro, quo a uobis philosophia deferesa et collaudata est,

The work alluded to is lost with the exception 11 a few fragments; it was
hamed aster the celebrated orator Q. Hortensius (111 ἓ 73), to whom it
was dedicated. It appears from ep. ad Att. xm 18 that the Hortensius
was written before the Academias were finished,¹ 11. before July uc. 45.
Augustine consess. 111 4 praises the work very highly, and says 11 111 ille
liber mutavit affectum roceum et ad te e'psuna Domine, mutavit preces meas et
votaaedesideria meafecitalio. ’ ·

enim, se'cut occursum est. So Gr. ἆπαντᾶν. Having disposed 01 the objec-
tion urged by the boni viri, Cicero now considers the objections 11 philoso-

phers and scholars (docti et eruditi), ¹ How can you’, say they, ‘an Academic, Ἴ

pretend to lay down fixed rules of duty, when it is a maxim 01 your sect
that nothing can be known? is not this a contradiction 11 your principles?
or will you admit that you don't know the truth 01 your own rules?'
Cicero‘s answer is that heis not one os the Sceptics or Aporetics, the
followers 11 Pyrrho, who held that 111 things were alike probable, and
nothing could have so much said 111 11, but that as much might be said
, against it, and accordingly doubted about everything. Nor was he one 11
the dogmatics, who held some things 1ο be absolutely certain and some un-
certain, but, adopting a middle opinion, he maintains with the Academics
that some things are highly probable and some improbable3 though, there-
fore, he does not positively affirm his rules as certain, yet as thinking them
so extremely probable that no wise man can refuse assent to them, heis
fully justified and quite consistent in laying them down. See Introd. ἓ 8.

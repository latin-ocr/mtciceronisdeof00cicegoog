1.1r. uocantem cet] now these two (ordo and opportunitas)
are comprehended under that seleuce, which the Greeks call εὐταξία,
not in its sense oi ‘sels-control' modestia, but in· that oi ‘correct
behaviour,’ propriety of our actions in regard to time and place.
Tacitus, hist. 11 3, employa the word dispositum to express the same
notion‚ and similarly Pliny epist. 111 1 speaks ot' dispositam vitam. ’

Lal. ut eandem nos ‘modestiam’ appellemus] ‘to call it also
modestia? P. S. Gr. p. 468. Cicero means that there is no Latin word
which will exactly render the Greek εὐταξίας modesti'o (Gr. μετριύτητ)
involves properly the notion of ‘moderatiori’ (modus Gr. μέτρον), he
takes a liberty therefore in using it in another sense, as equivalent to the
Greek εὐταξία. According to the Stoics it is the knowledge oi ranging
under their proper heads all that we have to say or to do; thus the
meaning os the words order (or regularityl and arrangement (or method)

is with them its fitness as to time, and the fitting time toran action is
called in Greek εὐκαιρία, in Latin occasio, ‘season‚’ so that modestia here
(in the sense of the word which is now given it) is to be understood as the
artos well-timing whatever we do. The Stoics defined εὐταξία (Sto-
baeus n p. 106) as ἐπιστήμη τοῦ πύτε πρακτέον καί τί μετά τι καί rodohan
τῆς τάξεως τῶν πραγμάτων. sse word is also applied to the harmony of
the individual soul, as when σωφροσύνη is defined to be εὐαρμοστία καί
εὐταξία ψυχῆς πρὸς τὰς κατὰ φύσιν ἡδονὰς καί λύπας.

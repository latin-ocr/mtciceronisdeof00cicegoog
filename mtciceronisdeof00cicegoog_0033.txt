par and all good actions equally good. On the other band, the
Wise Man alone is capable of true friendship and gratitudey
all that he does is right, he alone knows how to rule, how to
obey, because heis free from all passions and therefore the
only true king. Even the arts, as Poetry‚ Divination, Ora·
tory, he alone can practise properly, because for that also true
19 Morality is necessary. Thus the Stoics pictured to themselves
the contrast between the Wise and the Unwise Man, and
represented their Wise Man according to an ideal standard,
although they were ready to confess that such axioms contra-
vened actual facts. When asked for historical examples of
their ‘imaginary sage’ they could not reply. Even Zeno him-
self had not pretended to a personification of this ideal virtue,
and of course the Stoics could not allow followers of other,

systems to be what their own founder did not pretend to be.
20 In accordance with their definition of the highest principle

and of the essential of virtue, the Stoics defined Duty (καθῆκον)
to be that which there is a sufficient reason for doing, i. e. what is
appropriate and agreeable to nature. The first duty, therefore, as
was seen above, is to choose that which is agreeable to nature,
and we may consequently speak of animals doing their duty,
in so far as they act conformably to their nature; but the duty
of man is what reason prescribes. Accordingly separate duties
are derived from the precepts of reason or from the several·
virtum, as for example the duty of preserving outward ap·
pearances is prescribed by the virtue of moderation and dis·
cretion. The fulfilment of these, however, is not necessarily
a result of perfect intention or of virtue, but may originate
with certain outward motives, not in themselves objectionable.
According to the Stoics perfection of intention alone is a Good.
They cannot, therefore, class mere fulhlment of duty in itself
among good things, but only among the medium things, or, in
so far as the results offer some advantage, among those that
are desirable⁶³. They described those actions which, though

t 26. 1.. Pisone] Lucius Calpurnius L. F. L. N. Piso Frugi,
the annalist (Brut. 5 106, de leg. 1 5 6, ep. ad fam. 1x aa, a), was the
author oi the law which established a permanent commission (quaestio
perpetua) sor the trial of provincial Govemors who had been guilty of such
illegal acts as came under the denomination repetundae. The law was
carried by him when tribunus plebis, 3. 0. 149 (Brut. l.c.). Pighius (ann.
Rom. 11 p. 447) gives the following as the supposed text of the law: uti
quibus in provinciis magistratus populi Romani eorumve comites contra leges
pecum'os cepissent quz'eive commisissent, earum iniuriarum ergo Romae quiri-
tari iudr'eioque quaesito sua repetere provinciales possent. The experiment
was found to work so well that from time to time new laws were passed,
by which new courts oi a similar description were instituted sor the investi·
gation oi different offences, as the lex Iunia passed by M. Junius Brutus,
a tribune oi the plebs, the lex Seroilcb (3.0. 105), the lex Acilia passed by
M. Acilius Glabrio, tribune of the plebs (3.0. ror, Verr. Act. η i. 9), the
lex Cornelia passed by Sulla 3. 0. 81, and lastly the lex Iulia, passed by
C. Julius Caesar in his first consulship 30. 59. See Diet. os Antiq. Art.

1. 28. Italtoum bellum] called also the ‘Social’ or ‘Marsic war.’
because the Marsi were one oi the principal States engaged in it, was the
war occasioned by the struggles ol the Italian allies oi the Republic (3.0.
roo—88 to obtain for themselves admission to the privileges of Roman
citizens romana civitas). According to the statement oi Appian (bell. civ. ι
35), M. Livius Drusus had proposed a measure, recommending an enquiry
into the corrupt practices in the courts oi justice· This measure was ex-
tremely unpopular with the aristocratioal party aud roused their indignation
tosuch a degree, that they determined to resist all the other measure! ’

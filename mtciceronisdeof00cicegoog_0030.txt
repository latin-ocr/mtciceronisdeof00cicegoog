is agreeable to Reason? This question can only be answered
in detail, if we consider the various promptings of reason, of
which we shall speak later, hut, in general, the answer to it
presents itself that man’s reason is but a part of and efflux
from the universal reason, which pervades, shapes and rules
the whole world. Whatsoever, therefore, divine reason pre·

’ scribes as law, harmonizes also with man's reason, and so the
life according to reason (ὁμολογουμένως ζῆν) is to be sought
no less in the harmony with its own than with the laws of

⁴ ¹universal reason.

That state of the soul which qualifies us for such aperfect life 1:
is Virtue, or perfected disposition, which is accordingly defined
as διάθεσις ὁμολογουμένη or διάθεσις τῆς ψυχῆς σύμφωνος ἔαυιῇ
περὶ ὅλον τᾶν βίονω. As then Virtue is not desired from fear
or hope of something else, hut for its own sake, because it is the
highest good (αὐτοτελές), so is it also perfect happiness which
according to the nature of the soul consists only in its having
perfect harmony with itself and with the godlike. On the
other hand it follows from this that what is immoral is the
supreme absolute evil. This axiom of the Stoics puts them in
direct opposition to the Epicuream, who acknowledge that “
virtue is a great good, hut only for the advantages which
it confers; while the practical application of it leads thern
into conflict with all other schools of philosophy. All other 16
desirable things, such as wealth, dignity, power, heahh,
in one word all extemal advantages, which are not in our
own power, are desired not for their own sake but for the
happiness which they procure. They are not expedient in
all cases, but may be sometimes harmful, they may be em·
ployed' not only for good but also for evil⁵¹. The Stoics

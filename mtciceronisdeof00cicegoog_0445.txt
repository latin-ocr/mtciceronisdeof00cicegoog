spent the first cighteen years of his lise. Hc afterwards went to Athens in
tac. 333 and thence to Colophon and Mitylene and Lampsacus, where he
taught philosophy ior five years. In ac. 306 he went back to Athens and
purchased the famous κῆποι Ἐπικούρου in which he established his philo·
sophical school. Our principal source oi information respecting him is the
tenth book of Diogenes laertius, besides the hilosophical poem of Lucre·
tius dc rerum natura. Cicero dc linibus and ‹ie natura deorum, who writes
in a hostile spirit about his philosophy 3ηά unjustiy brands him as a man
devoted to sensual pleasures. Diogenes calls him πολυγραφώτατος and
gives a list oi the best oi his works together with some of bis letters and
the κύριαι δόξαν, ie. peculim propositions, containing the substance oi his
ethical philosophy. His most important work was that περὶ φύσεως ἱιι 37
books, parts oi which were discovered among the rolls at Herculaneum
and have been published. Epicurus pn'ded himself upon being monme-
τος, buthe was in reality indebted both to Democritus and the Cyrenaica.
His ethical system arose from the peculiar circumstances oi his time, when,
in the absence oi politicai ireedom, thinking men endeavoured to establish
an internal freedom based upon ethicai principles: they regarded perfect
independence, sels-reliance, and contentment as the summum bonum, fol.
lowing the dogma ol the Cyrenaics that pleasure constitutes the highest
happiness and consequently must be the end ot' all human exertions. But
pleasure with him was conceived oi not as⁸ a mere momentary and transi.

and incrtat-peace of mind based upon φρόνησις, which he described as
the beginning os everything good, as the origin os all virtues, and even a's
the summum bonum itsels. In the physicai part of his philosophy he
adopted the atomio theory of Democritus, as we know from Lucretius.

the Stoical philosophy, they never took firm root. See Dict. of Gr. and

quam habeat momenti gratio: again ep. ad Att. 1 17, 9 Asiam qui

dc caesoribus conduxerant, questi suntin senatu se cupiditate prolapsos
nimium magno cmcduxesse, ut induceretur (⁸sh0uld be cancelled ) locatio
postulaverunt: ego princeps in adiutoribus atque odeo secundus-Invidiosa
res, turpis postulatio et confessio temeritatis,· summum erat pmculum ne,
si nibil impetrassent, plane alienarentur a senatu, ib. 18, 7 unus est qui
citrct constantia magis et integritate quam, ut milri uidetur, consilio aut
ingenio, Cato, qui miseros publicanos, quos haberit amantissimas sui,
tertium r'om mensem vexat neque iis o senatu responsum clati patitur: tta
nos cogimur reliqm's de rebus nibil decernere, antequam publicanis
rcs usum sit.

plis& multa weila] Cicero is here thinking of Cato's rough pro
ceeding against Cyprus and its king Auletes, Μ. 58. ’

ln lios] sc. socios.

1. tt. oum tffls ato agere—soleremus] ‘to deal with the former as
we usually did with our own tenants,’ to whom we remit a portion of their
rent in bad years, see Plin. ep. tx 37. ·

ssoleremus] ‘are wont, as I then stated iu my speech ’, see note to

r. 12⁷, 1. 2. mota attam canobo. fecit. There were three eminent
men of the name Caius Scribonius Curio, avus, pater, filius, Plio.
h. n. vlt 41, uno sattellia Curionum in ‘qua tres corztinua serie oratores
extiterunt. The first (Curio pater) was a distinguished orator (eloquen-
tissimus temporibus suis de orat. 11 5 98, Brut. 5 m), who spoke inst
Servius Fulvius, when accused of incest. The second is the one re erred
to in the text aud again 11 5 59. He was tribune of the plebs Μ. 90,
and, after serving under Sulla in Graece, became praetor Μ. 82 and
consultae. 76. At the expiration of his consulship he was made pro·
consul of Macedonia, where he carried the war against the barbarians
as far north as the Danube, and celebrated a triumph over the Dardanians
in 71 (in Pis. 5 44). An intimate friend aud supporter of Cicero, he
entertained a personal eumity to Caesar, which was probably the cause
why he spoke in favour of Clodius wheu accused of violating the sacra
of the Bona Dea: in Μ. 57 he was made pontifex maximus. Cicero
speaks highly of him as a man, (ep. ad Quint. fr. 11 3, a, iu Vatin. 5 ²4
perpetuum hostem improborum omnium, auctorem publici consilii, libertate
coenmuni tuenda maxime liberum), but he did not shine asan orator,
orator Latine non pessime loquebatur, sed erat indoctus, memoria nulla,
artebne ridiculus, Brut. 5213,5216-217,5aao. His son was also a
friend of Cicero, the first seven letters of whose second book of epistulae
&santelmus are addressed to him, but unlike his father, a profligate. He
was married to Fulvia, who afterwards became Antony’s wife. He was
one of the main instruments in kindling the war between Caesar and
Pompey and on the breaking out of the war served under Caesar and fell
in battle against Juba and the Pompeian party.

1. 8. muopadanorum] The Latin colonies in that part of Cisalpine
Gaul which lay north of the Po, who, not content with the ius Latii given
them after the Marsic war by the lex Pompeia, claimed but were refused the
lascivitatis, which had been granted to the Cispadani aud which they
afterwards obtained from Caesar when dictator Μ. 49.

l. 4. mnus tlooeret] a past imperative, ‘he should rather have proved,'

ΒΟΤΗ Text, Analysis and Commentary in this Third
Edition have been again subjected to a thorough

revision. To the explanatory notes Ι have found it

necessary to add some sixty pages of new matter, '2²

while of the old compression here, expansion there,
and, where superfluous or erroneous, excision has been
employed unsparingly; numerous fresh illustrations have
been given and frequent reference has been made to
the Grammars of Zumpt, Madvig, Draeger‚ Kennedy,
Key and Roby. A few notes will be found distin-
guished by the initials J. E. Β. Μ.; for these I arn in-
debted to Professor Mayor of Cambridge. ¹

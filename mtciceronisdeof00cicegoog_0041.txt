books, but it was left incomplete, being deficient⁸⁰ in the third
part on the conflict between virtue and expediency.

30 The part which was wanting in Panaetius Cicero treated·
independently, ie. without having a model to follow, such as
he had in the first books in Panaetius, in the division and the
discussion os his subject⁸¹s we leam from his own statement⁸⁸
that he consulted sor that purpose a work of Posidonius,
the pupil of Panaetius; he seems however not to have borrowed
much from it, as Posidonius touched but slightly on this part
ol the doctrine os duties, and in general nothing that was written
on ethics since the time os Panaetius met with Cicero's appro-
bationffl. He made use moreover of an essay os Hekaton os
Rhodes, out os which he takes the divergent views of Diogenes
and Antipater⁸⁴, and itis very likely that the case stated in
111 5 91, about which these two philosophers shew the same
difl'erence os opinion, is also borrowed from it.

31 It is an interesting question how much Cicero borrowed
from these sources and what is of his own creation; whether

-as is seen to be the case in some parts os the books denatura
deorum from the fragment os the Epicurean Philodemus-he has
furnished scarcely anything but a free translation of the Greek
original, or whether in addition to the Roman dress in which he
has clothed them and the examples taken from Roman history,
he has given us his own sentiments also. The latter supposition
is supported by Cicero's own observation sequimur—potissimum

¹ t. m. rebus repertus] ‘after a formal demand of satisfaction’ The
formal and public declaration of war was an indispensable preliminary to
it among the Romans· This declaration was either conditional or purer
The conditional was when it was made cum rernm repetitam, ‘a formal
demand for the restoration of the things in question‚' on the expiration of
33 days. This was called clarigatio (Liv. 1 32, rv 30, v11 6, x ra, xxxvr
3). A pure declaration (indictio) was without any condition, as when an
injury could not be redressed ; or when war was first declared by the other
party. See Grotius dc Iure Belli ac Pacis 111 c. 3, ς 7 (Vol. 111. p. 62,
ed. Whewell). Comp. Liv. xxxvl 3 where the finales before the war with
the Aetolians give out amicitiam renuntiatam ονἐίενί, cum legatis totiens
repetentibus res nec reddi nec satisfieri aequum censuissent.

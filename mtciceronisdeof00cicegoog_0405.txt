Personal servitudes were those which were enjoyed immediately by a
particular person, without being attached toan estate, whereas real ser·
vitudes are appurtenant to lands. The easements of the English law
correspond in some respect with the servitudes ol Roman law. See

Η. ln mancipio] sc. faciendo, ‘in the conditions of'sale,’ de orat.
1 5 178 in mancipii lege, ie. ‘in the contract ol sale! By the Roman
law ‘ownership os property' (dominium) was acquired by individuals
either iure gentium or iure civili ‘by the Quiritarian law of Rome.'
In the latter case by 1. mancipatio, a. in iure cessio, 3. traditio, 4. usu-
capio (i. e. uninterrupted possession ol' a thing sor one or two years), 5.
adiudicatia, 6. lex. Mancipatio is thus defined by Gaius 1 119:
est mancipatio imaginaria quaedam occiditio-capu res ita agitur:
adhibitis ozon atinus quam quinque testibus, ciuibus Romanis puberibus ct
praetcrea alio ciusdem condicionis, qui libram auctam teneat, qui appellatur
libripens, isqui mancipio accipitrem tenens ita dicit: Hunc ego horni-
nem (vel hanc rem) ex iure Quiritium meum esse aio, isque
mihi em tus est hoc aere aeneaque libra: deinde acre (ie. numo)
percutit libram, idque acsdatci, aquo mancipio accipit, quasi pretii Ioco.
Mancipium means (ι) the formal purchase per acs et libram, or (a) the
property, right of absolute ownership‚ acquired by such purchase, so that
he can alienate it at pleasure, especially a slave. Hence Lucretius 111971
says vitaque mancipio nulli datar, omnibus usu, ie. nature gives none the
mancipium ex iure Quiritium, the full and absolute ownership 'of lise3
she only lends it, keeping the dominium to herself. Cp. Horace Epist. 11
a, 159-160 si proprium estquod quis libra mercatur et acre, quaedam si
credis consultis, mancipat (‘gives a title to’) usus (tq. usucapio).

By the ancient civil law things were divided into res mancipi and res
uec mancipi, ie. ‘things which could‚’ and ‘things which could not be
acquired as absolute property.’ To the former belonged lands, slaves, and
ordinary beasts os horden, such as homes, oxen, mules, &c Maine Ancient

not mentioned by the seller, though he knew it, ought to be made good:
Antonius, on the equity ol the· case, that, inasmuch as the fault in ques-

in question, there was no reason lor its being specified (on occasion of the

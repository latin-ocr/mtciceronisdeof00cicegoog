Introduction xix Δ

not wholly coincide with the principles originally advanced
by him. It is one of his characteristics that, following in9
the steps of his contemporary Antiochus the Academic, he
strives to reconcile the different schools of philosophy and to
obliterate their antagonism. Thus he not only disregards the
distinction between the sceptics of the new Academy and the
school of Plato¹⁶, but maintains also that there was no material
difference between· the Platonics and Peripatetics²⁷. Even the
Stoica he contends, have borrowed all from the Academics and
Peripatetics and changed the names only⁹⁸‚ or, even if were·
cognize any difference between them- and the Peripatetics, such
difference can exercise no influence on special Morality⁹⁰. In
other places, however, Cicero points out the distinction between
the two schoolsw, without regard to the contradiction in which
he thereby involves himself. ,
Of all the philosophical systems that prevailed at Rome 10

the Epicurean was the one which Cicero most disliked³¹t
he is sometimes even unjust to it, and in his attacks upon
it exhibits more rhetorical pathos than philosophical argu·
ment³'. Thus his choice lay between the Stoic, Peripatetic
and Academic schools, the latter of which at that time, having
been reformed by Antiochus, sought to reconcile the other
two. He finds fault with the Peripatetics because in ¹their
theory of the affections they justify fear and anger as natural
and do not attempt to eradicate such weaknesses³⁸. In ethics
also he was influenced more or less by Antiochus, as the books
definitus shew. But on the whole he decided in favour of the
Stoics, as far as ethics were concerned, not only by propound·
ing their views, but also by borrowing from them whenever it

1. ³6. haec non turpe] ‘is it not scandalous that philosophers should

P. 12³, 1. 2. quicum-mices] ‘to play at odd and even with,' 5 90
l. 25. Sueton. div. Aug. 13al1as‚patremetfilium, protrita rogantes sortiri
vel micare iussae, ut alterutri concederetur. The word micare was ap·
plied to a simple game of the Romans which is still common enough among'
their descendants and called la marra, in French la maurre. The garne is
this: of two persons one, at a given signal, quickly opens any number oi his
fingers. At the same moment the other endeavours to match his opponent
by opening the same number. In the light, of course, each could see, as soon
as it was done, whether the guess was right. ln the dark, honesty would be
the only check to deception r hence to play with a man in the dark implied
full confidence in him. See note by SirJ. G. Wilkinson in Rawlinson's
Herodotus 1 ch. 95. Qucum (tq. quaerem=ut cumea) is generally used
by Cicero, when the subject or person is indefinite, 1 5 37 eum quicum bella

vinciam, ‘to sweep the province clean! The metaphor is borrowed from
a ‘broom,' or from a ‘drag-net' called verriculum.

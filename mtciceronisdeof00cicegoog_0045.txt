xxxviii Introduction

which are proved by examples rather than by general consi-
derations, we may trace more'or less the results of Cicero’s
own personal experience, and this constitutes the chief charm
of this work and its superiority over some of his other waitings.
But the proofs which he makes use of are merely superficial ;
we look in vain for any profound discussion on philosophica]
principles, for any psychological system, and, where abstract
questions are inevitable, they are treated without any tech-
nical knowledge or subtilty of reasoning.

37 This is undoubtedly a defect in the Work. It may be
explained partly by the fact that Cicero was without pro-
found philosophical training, partly by the fact of his mind

being more directed towards questions of practica] interest,
partly because he composed the work carelessly and under un·

favourable circumstances. On the other hand he does not
adopt the scholastic distinctions and definitions of the Stoica
which are equally useless for philosophy and practice. He
exhibits always sound sense and wide experience, such as is ,
possessed only by one who from his earliest years has been
conversant with public life and taken an active partin forensic
business, who once stood himself at the head of the state and
was the leader of a great political party. Moreover his true·
moral instinct keeps him as far aloof from the ambiguities
of Diogenes’ morality, as from the rudeness which even Chry·
sippus had caught from Cynicism. His noble patriotism, his
Roman pride coupled with his love for Greek learning, are
always apparent, and, if he is deficient in systematic philo
sophy, the want is in some degree at least compensated by
his everlasting moral axiom that what is virtuous is always
38 and alone expedient-On the other hand the dcofficr'r‘s is justly
taxed with faulty arrangement and frequent repetitions. In
the second Book conceming the question how we can make
others useful to ourselves, Cicero gives the same subdivision
twice over ἓ 21 and ἓ 2‘2‚ but in ἓ 31 he abandons it and makes
the whole subordinate to the question how we are to acquire
fame. He recurs oftener than necessary to certain very fami-
liar questions. So his remarks in 1 c. 37 on the power of

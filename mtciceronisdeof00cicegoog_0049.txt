xlii Introduction

reading (e. g. 1 ἓ 28 in altero delinquunt, 11 ἓ 76 abstinentiae sor
sapientiae, §89 quid tertium? male pascere for male vestire),
that the writer must undoubtedly have had access to a source
in many respects superior to that from which the codices of
the other family spring. On the other hand the codex, from
which Bern. c. emanates, has been subjected to the most ca·
pricious alterations of reading. Entire changes in the order of
words, corrections such as 1 ἓ 77 concedat laurea paci for c. l.
laudi, 1 §88 lenitudo animi for altitudo animi, numerous mis·
placed attempts at emendation, leave no room for doubt that
the copyist, whoever he was, has purposely tampered with
the text, whereas the corruptions of the other codices arise
rather from the ignorance or carelessness of the transcribers:
we must therefore employ these in the first instance for ascer-
taining and settling the text, while great caution is necessary in
using Bernensisc, although we cannot entirely do without it.
The edatio pn'nceps was printed at Mayence in 1465 by Fust
and Schbfler‚ the second at Mayence in 1466 by Fust and de
Gernshem, the third at Rome by Sweynheym and Pannartz in
1469, the fourth at Venice by de Spita in 1470 ; the first of these
is extremely rare. More than thirty editions were published be·
fore the close of the fifteenth century. · 01 subsequent editions
those of Aldus (1517) and (1541), the Augsburgh (1535), the
Venice (1538) ed. by Paulus Magnolus‚ and ’(1581), the Ant·
werp (1563), the Bale (1568), the Amsterdam (1688) by J. G.
Graevius with vorthrum notes (1710), reprinted by Garatoni,
Naples 1777, the Oxford (1695) 67 T. Cockman, that of
Facciolati (Padua 1720, reprinted at Venice‘ 1747), deserve
attention.
. There are several English Translations, 67 R. Whytinton
(London 1534, 1540), 67 Nicholas Grimalde (London 1553, ’
frequently reprinted), by Roger l'Estrange (London 1680), 67
T. Cockman (London 1706, frequently reprinted), by Guthrie
(1755). The best German translation is by Dr R. Ktihner,
Stuttgart‚ 1859.

1. 19. aad quonlam a quanam 111] On the deficiency of this classi·
fication and the carelessness shewn in subjoining it here for the first time
see Introd. 539, cp.15117. · We may remark further, that this supple·
mentary division inserted here, which occurred to Cicero probably only
while writing, obliges him to' repeat what he said above ae dc iis quedem,
quac videntur—arbitror dictum ¹in the words oc de prudentia quidem cet.
The words 5 71 quocirca astutiae tollendae sitiet eaque malitia, quae vult
illa uidem arderi se esse prudentiam are generally regarded as the end of

the ἔτεϊ section on false prudence. liet Cicero would have expressed him·

sslf more distinctly if he had meant to distinguish the examples from one
another in this manner ; at any rate in all cases, where apparent expedi·
ency is preferred to virtue, injustice as well asa misconception of true

· expediency and therefore false prudence shews itself; accordingly they-are

not easily distinguished from each other. The following examples likewise
shew a conflict of expediency with justice more than with high-mindedness.
Still all this does not amount to a reason for pronouncing the words ac de
prudentia—temperantiae to be an interpolation, as many do. For the
words sed quoniam-virtutis ininu'ca could only form the transition to the
next division, which is to treat of the conflict between high-mindedness and
expediency, on the supposition that mrtus=magnitudo aninn'. As it is,
Cicero never uses uirtus in contradistinction to iustitia. Even if virtus
had this sense here, the point would have been missed: because we derive
duties from four kinds of virtue, we shall have to deal with the same four
kinds of virtue, when we treat of the conflict between expediency and
high-mindedness. Finally‚ if the first division treated of the conflict be·
tween apparent prudence and justice, and the second part began only here,
Cicero could not say as he does c. 33 restat quarta pars. Heine.

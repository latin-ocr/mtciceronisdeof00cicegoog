5'1'1, Lu murtam] C. Flavius Fimbria, colleague ol Marius
in his second consulship s.c.1o4, was killed in the civil wars between
Marius and Sulla. He is called consularis here to distinguisb him from
the Caius Fimbria, lieutenant to Lucius Flaccus when proconsul of Asia,
whom he killed at: 85, and a year afterwards committed suicide, being
conquered by Sulla. See Bmt. 51²9 C. Fimbria-habitus est sane, ut
ita dicam, truculentus asper malede'czn, genere loto paulo fervidior atque
commotior, diligentia tamen et virtute aniari alque m'ta bonus auctor in
renatae. lelem tolerabilis palronus nee rudis in iureeim'li etcum virtute

iam reperire vra possumus.

1. 2⁷. oum is sponsionem lecisset] ‘aster be had laid a wager, to be
forfeited il he did not prove that he was vir bonus! Under the sormulnry
system (5 60 1. 19 note) as Gaius says (1v5 91) in rem actio duplex est: aut
enim per foratam petitoriam agdur aut per sponsionem. By the former the
plaintiff claimed the property as his own; by the sponsio a sort os judi-
cial wager was entered into calleda simulatio pra praede lite's et m'ndi-
cimam, as a preliminary proceeding with a view to obtaining a decision on
the case. One of the forms has been preserved by Gaius (1v593l—Si
horno, qua clangitur, ex iure Qniritium maes est, xxv numos dare spondes?
-to which the adversarius replied spondeo. When the sponsio was
made by one party, it was termed sponsio praeiudicialis, and was
adopted merely as a convenient form oi bringing the matter to an issue, the
sum not being exacted if the plaintiff was successful, Ramsay, Rom. Ant.
p. 283.

1. 29. 11 sonim iudicavisset] Had Fimbria been speaking in the
first person, he would have said, si eontra indicaverim: hence in the
oblique we have si contra iudicavisset, 5 45 l. a, Kenu. Gr. p. 485.

1. 30. statuisse videratur] ‘should seem to have pronounced some·
body to bea good man, when such a character is, as he said, made up of
such an infinity os duties and praiseworthy qualities.’

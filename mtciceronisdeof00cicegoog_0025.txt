possibility of all knowledge but, starting from the axiorn that
absolute certainty is unattainable in questions of speculative
philosophy, to find out by inquiry that which after sifting all,
the conflicting opinions of philosophers has most probability
in its favour and thus to secure himself against the foolish
presumption of those who would establish absolute certainty,
where certainty is‘impossible (1158, Acad. 11 3, 7). In place
of absolute and certain knowledge he prefers the probable,
probabile. In all questions of a purely speculative nature we ·
’ must, he says, rest satisfied with this, except where in par-
ticular questions, such as that concerning the existence of the
gods, the inbom sense is so strong that probability becomes
8certainty⁹⁸. But as philosophy has to teach us only the right
method of conduct, these speculative questions are 01 se·
candary importance in comparison with those of a practical
bearing, and in order to secure us against error in our actions,
the discovery of the probabile is enough, as Kameades taught⁹⁴.
⁴ Our natural feeling 01 what is right and on the other hand
the evidence 01 our senses make it possible to distinguish the
True from the False. The objection therefore against Cicera,
that as 'a Sceptic he had no right to lay down definite rules²⁵ ’
on moral obligations, is groundless and all the more so, be·
cause in his ethical treatises he has avoided Scepticism more
than in his other writings. From a positive point 01 view he
rejects the doctrine of Epicurus and agrees with the principles
of the Stoics and Peripatetics, and particularly in questions
01 special morality he does not admit Scepticism at all. ln fact
he lays down in this branch of Ethics a definite system, though
he certainly fails to carry it out with much consistency‚ modi-
fying it when practical interests require and supplementing it
· with additions borrowed from other systems, even if these do

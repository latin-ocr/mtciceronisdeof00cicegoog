Introduction xxix

classed the πρῶτοι κατὰ φύσιν already mentioned, together with
wealth, honour, high birth, and their contraries, ἀποπροηγμένα,
νειοῖο, ‘undesirable things⁶⁷.' Between these two lie the ἀδιά-
φορα in the proper sense os the term, those things which excite
neither desire nor aversino, as the raising this or that finger,
the taking up a leaf from the ground ornot. .

Although in opposition to the wise man all not wise men 23
are fools, yet the later Stoics modified the assertion, that all
unwise men are equally bad; by which they ran counter to the' ’
general sentiment. They agreed that there was a state of
‘progression' (προκοπή) or improvement, and that some were
iarther removed from their ideal than othersffl. This was in ’
accordance with their idea os virtue, sor, like all the Socratic
schools, they defined Virtue as a Science. Wisdom (σοφία)
is that which lies at the foundation os every virtue⁵⁰. Virtue
therefore can be taught and acquired by gradual progress.
,Thus the Stoics could write in a practical way about duties,
when they set aside their distinction between the Wise and
the Unwise.

For the development of the special virtues the Stoics ap 24 ’
pealed to primary natural impulses, and maintained that the
desire to live conformably to reason shews itself in a sourfold
manner:

1 as the desire os enquiry alter the True and the Just,

⁵7 Diog.Laert.V11 roo, Cic. Acadt 537. ‘⁶ This famous distinction
between things προηγμένα and ἀποπροηγμένα was a compromise between
the paradox that ‘nothing is good but virtue‚’ and the practical facts ol
lise. Stoicism is forced to be suu of such compromises.’' Sir A. Grant,
Oxford Essays‚ 1858, p. 88. ,

⁶⁸ “This notion of conscious moral progress,’' observes Sir Α. Grant,
l. c. p. 93, “and seli-discipline is too familiar now for us easily to believe
that it was first introduced into Greece in the third century tao It may
be said indeed to be contained implicitly in Aristotle's theory of ‘habits’3
but it is in reality the expression oi a new and totally different spirit. By
this spirit we shall find the later Stoics deeply penetrated. It constituted
perhaps the most purely moral notion of antiquity‚ as implying the deep·
est associations which are attached to the word ‘moral'.”

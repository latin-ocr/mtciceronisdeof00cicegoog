172 mitis sapientia Laeli. The person meant is Gaius Laelius the
younger, the distinguished statesman, soldier and man of letters, who
was born about tac. 186, consul nc.¹ 140 with Q. Servilius Caepio
(de am. 596), and whose intimate friendship with Scipio Africanus the
younger (de am. 1 5 4, de rep. 15 18, deofl 15 118, de or. 11 5 aa)
is constantly spoken of by Cicero as an example of what friendship should
be. He distinguished himself against Viriathus in Spain tac. 145 (11 5 40),
buthe was more of a statesman than a soldier and more of 1 philoso her
than a statesman. He imbibed the doctrines of the Stoic school m
Diogenes Babylonius and Panaetius, and was a friend of Polybius and
Terence, whose plays were by some ascribed to him. As tribune, he en·
deavoused (according 1ο Plutarch Tib. Gracch. c. 8) to procure 1 redivision
of the public land, but desisted from the attempt, and for his forbear-
ance was designated Sapiens (11540), 111 5 16, Tusc. 4 5 5, Brut. 5 213,
5 84. He afterwards became a staunch snpporter of the optimates. The
treatise deamicitia is called Laelius after him (11 5 31) because he is
the chief interlocutos in the dialogue. He is also one of the speakers 111
the de senectute and in the de republica. His grandfather was a con—
temporary of the elder Scipio Africanus, and consul with his brother
Scipio Asiaticus uc. 190.

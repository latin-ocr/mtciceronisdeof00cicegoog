Q, Hortensium] the celebrated orator.

1. 10. cum illud-repudiaverunt] ‘although they suspected it to bea
forgery, yet being conscious of no moral guilt in the matter, they did not
spurn the paltry present, procured by other people’s villany.' On·the
meaning of culpa see Kiihner n. to Tusc. 111 δ 34 videt neolum nullum esse
nisi cul pom ; culpam autem nullom esse, curn id, quod ab leomine nonpotuerit
praestan, evenerit, ep. ad fam. rx 16 nihil esse sapientis praestare nisi cul·
pam (ἁμάρτημα ἴδιον).

1. 17. munusculum] ironical diminutive, used with contempt, see

001111 est 1100, ut] ‘is this (i. e. the fact 01 their not having had
any share in forging the will) sufficient to absolve them from being thought
to have done wrong? N0; in my opinion it is not ; though I always loved
one of them (Hortensius, 11 ξ 57), while he lived, and am 00 enemy to
the other, now that he is dead and gone.' Cicero's liking for his rival
Hortensius is attributed by Cornelius Nepos (vit. Att. 5110111011οοῐο-
1000 friendship with Atticus ut intellegi non posset, uter eum plus diligeret,
Cicero an Hortensius: et id, qnod erat difficillimum, efficielrm, ut inter
quos tantae laudis esset aemulatio, nullo intercederet obtrectatio essetque
talium virorum copula. Hortensius after the coalition 01 Pompey with
Caesar and Crassus (0.0. 60) withdrew from public life and confined him-
self to his duties as an advocate3 he died mc. 50. Once only alter his
retirement did he appear iu public, viz. rae. 55, to oppose the sumptuary
law 01 Pompey and CrassuS, the repeal 01 which he obtained. For Crcero's
sentiments towards Crassus see ep. ad fam. 1 9, 10 cum me disputan·
tem, non lacessentem laesisset, exorsi non solnm praesentiendi), iracundia,—
sed curn inclusum illud odium meritorum eius (Crassi) in me iniuriarum,
quod ego effudisse me omne arbitrabar, residuum tamen insciente ene suisset,
omne repente apparuit. The origin 01 their enmity was that Cicero had
charged him with complicity in the Catalinarian conspiracy, Plut. Crass. ·
13, Sallust Cat. 48. Besides Crassus was on terms 01 friendship with
Clodius, Cicero‘s bitterest enemy, and had prevented his condemnation
(ad Att. 1 16, 5), and therefore had neither opposed Cicero's hanish·
ment nor worked sor his return. Still Crassus sought to be reconciled
with Cicero after his return (Plut. Cic. 33), andan apparent reconcilia-
tion took place between them before Crassus' departure sor Asia: ad
fam. ibid. cum Ponmeius ita contendisset, ut nihil umquam rizans, ut cum
Crasso redirem in gratiam—lami non temporum solum rationem meorum,
sedetiam naturae, Crassusque, ut quasi testata populo Romano essct nostra
grotta, paene a ineis Laribus in provinciam est prefictus.

H. Satrium] called after his adoption M. Minucius Basilus Sa-
trianus. He was a confederate 01 Antonius, spoken of contemptuously
by Cicero Phil. 11 ξ 107 as patronus of Italian townships: vexavit (Anto-
nius) Puteolanos, quod C. Cassium et Brutos patronos adoptassent. Magno
quidem studio, iudicio, benevolentia, caritate, reon ut te (sc. Antony) et Ba·
silum vi et armis et alios vestri similes, uos clientes nemo habere velit, non
modo illorum cliens esse. He is doubtless a different man from the L.
Minucius Basilus, who served as legatus of Caesar in his Gallie wars and is
spoken 01 as one of his murderers by Appian 11 113, Cic. ad fam. vi 15.

Sulla visited him with cruel retribution for this popularity. He was

a formidable political adversary, and in the eyes of the aristocratic party he

had committed a veritable crime in assailing a right oi the State to alter

the value oi the coinage. As soon therefore as the dictator entered Rome,

all the statues os Gratidianus were overthrown, and he himself proscribed

have its value defined and settled,' ‘its standard fixed by a joint resolution.'
The lex Flaminia, passed ata great crisis oi peril to the Republic, when
Hannibal was now at the gates oi the city, suddenly reduced the silver
derrarius, which became from that time the true standard os value, from
ᾗ to ᾗ of a pound. It was this law which established the false principle of
’ regarding gold and silver coinage merely as a conventional sign oi value,
subject to the will ot the sovereign or the state. By means oi the theory os
the money-sagn the monied oligarchy os Rome produced grave perturbations
in the monetary system by salsisying the coins. In each successive issue of
amarti there was a larger and larger proportion of plated pieces (ie. oi
money containing only a thin coating os the true metal over copper or iron),
omiliae. 91 M. Livius Drusus caused the Senate to pass a decision that
in suture issues there should be one plated copper denariae to seven oi
silver. A lew years later, in Cinna's time, the value of the coinage had
become so dubious that no one knew what he was worth (quid liaberet).
In sac. 84 the tribunes oi the people and the praetors deliberated on the
measures to be taken in order to remedy this deplorable state of things.
An edictos the praetors instituted officers ior the verification oi the coinage,
suppressed the ensorced circulation os the plated denarii, ordered that they
should be withdrawn srom the public coffers and that derearii oi a true
standard should be given in exchange. See an excellent Article on Money
in Greece and Rome in the contemporary Reoiew, Feb. 1879, by F ranpois

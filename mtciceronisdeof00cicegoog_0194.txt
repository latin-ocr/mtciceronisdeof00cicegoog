in Lucian Hermai. 582, Aul. Gell N. Α. 1. c. 13. Cicero tells us himself
why he prefers the title deffcz'is to deofficio (Ep. ad Attic. XV1 11, ἕ a),

inscriptam quaerat, non dubito quin καθῆκον officium sit, nisi quid tu

Virum estnon ἀνοίκειον. It agrees better with Cicero’s treatment o the
subject of ‘moral duties,’ inasmuch as these vary with a man’s socia] position
and other circumstances which he considers in this treatise, see1§ raa-

CHAPTER I.

1². ὃς 1, 1. 1. mum iam audientem] Cicero sent his son to Atheus
about the first of April lae. 45, as he tells us in a letter to Atticus written
the next year (xv 15), in which speaking of bis sou he writes scnpsitod
Tironem sibi post Kal. April-sic enim annuum tempus confici—nihii
datum esse. As Cicero speaks in the text of his son annum iam oudz'entem
Cratippum, it is inserted that he began this Treatise in the spring or early
in the summer of uc. 44, two or three months at most after the assassina·
tion of Caesar. On the other hand, the following reasons may be given.
for believing that the treatise was not commenced until the autumn of the,
same year. (ι) Iu the very frequent letters of this period, which give us a
full account almost of the daily occupations of Cicero, there is no mention
of a work dt oyiciis until Oct. 24 (Ep. od Au. xv 13). (a) Cicero implies
(Off 111 ἕ rar that this book was intended as a substitute for the instruc-

out on a voyage, he was driven back to the vicinity of Rhegium on thegfith
of August, and was induced to give up his visit to his son and return to,
Rome by the representations of his riends that a favourable change in
public affairs bad taken place, and that his presence was demanded. He
reached the Capitol on the last day of August, and having ou September
the and delivered his first Philippic, retired soon after to his villa at
Puteoli. Here he spent the months of October and November, and is sup-
posed to have employed himself in writing this work. It is agreed that it
was finished before the ninth of December. A. W. Zumpt suggests that
the disagreement may be reconciled by sup osing that the young Cicero,
although he left home on the first of April, <iia not for some time actually
commence his attendance on the instructions of Cratippus, and further,
that Cicero does not intend to speak with exactness in using the werde

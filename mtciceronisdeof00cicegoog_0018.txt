enlarged and improved edition os that before published
by Unger. I have found great assistance from his corn-
rnentary, which leaves few difficulties unnoticed. The
Introduction prefixed to this edition is substantially
a translation of his Einleitung. However much the
possession of these aids and appliances has diminished
editorial work, the mere task of selection and corn-
pression os materials, easy as it may appear to those
who have had no experience of it, is a constant strain
upon the judgrnent which requires no ‘inconsiderable
expenditure of time and labour. ⁸

Wherever the actual words of the annotator have
been quoted, Ι have given his name: where the derived
notes have undergone a change of form, I have not
made any special acknowledgment os the original
source from which they are taken. In thex text Ι have
followed sor the most part the recension os Orelli’s
Cicero by Baiter and Halm, which must at present
be considered the standard edition. In some passages,
where a different reading has commended itself to my
judgment, I have given that of Baiter inthe adnotatio
critica, and in any variations of importance added the
readings of the principal editors.

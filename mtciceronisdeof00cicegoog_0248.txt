wards at Athens under the stoic Diogenes of Babylon, and Polemo, and
his pupil Antipater of Tarsus. kt Rome he became acquaiuted with
Laelius and Scipio Africanus the younger, and, like Polybius before
him, gained his friendship (de fin. 1v 5 ²3 homo in primis ingenuus et‘

and accompanied him on an embassy to the kings of Egypt and-Asia
in alliance with Rome (P. Africani historiae loquuntur in legatione

Anti ater as head of the Stoic school, belore lac. rrr,⁴in which year
L. drassus found there ‘auditor Panaetii Mnesarchus,’ not Panae-
tius himself (de orat. 15 45, de div. 1 5 6 Panaetius vel princeps

. The principal work of Panaetius was his treatise on the theory of
moral obligatron (περὶτοῦ καθήκοντος) in three books, eomposed thirty
years before his death (de off. 11158). In this he proposed to investigate
firstly what was moral (honestum) or immoral (turpe), then what was
expedient (utile), or not expedient (inutile), and lastly how the apparent
conflict between the honestum and utile was to be decided. The third
subject of enquiry he had not completed, and it was left to Cicero, who
in the first two books borrowed from Panaetius without any essential
alteration, to deal with it independently and without assistance (de off.

seruit, de tertio pollicetur se deinceps, sed nihil scripsit. Cicero was induced
to follow Panaetius not merely because of the superiority- of his work
in other respects, but because he endeavoured to exhibit the philosophy
ol morals in its practical application to life, laying aside abstract in·
vestigations and paradoxical definitions (de off. 11 5 35), and modifying
the severity which characterised the older school ol Stoics (defin. lv 5 79

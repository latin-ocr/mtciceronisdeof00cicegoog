os public activity. The part concerning justice is taken up
with the questions what are just reasons for commencing a
war, how conquered enemies are to be treated: and these
questions are not discussed from a philosopher’s point os view
but from that os a Roman statesman. The following part on
magnanimity (magnitudo antini) is treated entirely with reser-
ence to Romans who occupy a high position in the state. We
find the writer constantly giving way to the complaint that
men endeavouring to attain prominent power and authority
so easily become dangerous to the community⁹³3 those who
are prevented from secking public offices from sear os trouble
and the uncertainty os success are censured⁹⁴z and, in addition
to several precepts for those who are govemors ol the state‚' the
question whether the office ol a general or that os a statesman
be the more useful and honourable is discussed with special
fulness. His remarks about the different kinds of speech (1 c.
37, cp. 11 c. 14) are merely a repetition os⁸ the thoughts which
are propounded in his oratorical writings. Lastly‚ none but a
Roman could talk as Cicero does in 1 c. 4² conceming the '
several vocations becoming a gentleman.

The independent judgment of Cicero is still more visible ³6
in his second Book. We have only to look at such pas-
sages as chapters 13 and 14 containing advice to a young
Roman, who is desirous of winning glory and authoritytwith
the people‚ or c. 15-24 on the acquisltion os popularity by
means ol public distributions‚ on the administration os public
offices‚ and on popular laws and institutions, to be convinced
that we are not reading a mere translation srorn a Greek philo
sopher. But the treatise is deficient as a philosophical system:
it often loses by confusion⁹⁵. This portion of the work and the
entire arrangement of his subject is entirely borrowed from
Panaetius-who however is not chargeable with Cicero’s want
of cleamess in exposition ; in the other true and striking but
loose and scattered remarks and precepts, which are derived
less from Stoic principles than from Roman views os life and

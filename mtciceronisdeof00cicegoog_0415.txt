refers of course to Metellus, although the simple pronoun of reference aeni
had been used in speaking of him before in the same sentence: the reason
is, that another subject intervenes viz. populum Romanum, hence the

made him very popular, so that statues were raised in all the public places
to the author of so beneficent a reform, and almost divine honours were
paid to these statues by burniug incense and wax tapeis before them.

We are told particularly that he was the first to divide virtues
into theoretical and practical⁷⁵, that is to say, he combined
the Platonic-Stoic division into four virtues with the Aristo

practical (ἠθικαὶ), distinguishing prudence as a theoretical‚ the
other three as practical virtues⁷⁶. As to the objection which 29
Cicero makes⁷⁷ that he did not begin his work with a definition

which it was composed. Besides the word had already a fixed
definition in the Stoic school. Panaetius requires rather to be

Horace says (ΕΡ. 1 1, 18) to observe his precepts is mihi res, non me
rebus subiungere, and (1 ιη, 23) οσινιὶι Aristippum decuit color et status
et res. To Xenophon aud Plato he was very obnoxious. Aristotle too
calls him a sophist. The Cyrenaics divided philosophy into five parts,
viz. the study ol (ι) objects of desire and aversion, (ι) feelings and
affections‚ (3) actions, (4) causes, (5) prooss.

1· In the first alone os these divisions is the Cyrenaic view connected
with the Socratic. Aristippus taking up the Socratic position that
happiness (i. e. the enjoyment ol a well-ordered mind) is the aim of all
men, pronounced leasure the chief good and pain the chief evil, the
τέλος of human fite to be momentary pleasure (μονόχρονος, μερικὴ)ι
present happiness therefore was to be sought, and not tricorporis, which

ceris was probably a contemporary ol Alexander the Great; he forms a
link between the Cyrenaic and Epicurean schools. He was opposed to
Epicurus in two points: (1) he denied that pleasure was merely the absence
ol pain, sor it so death would be a pleasure; and (ι) he attributed to every
separate act a distinct object, maintaining that there was no general end of
human lif. He differed from Aristippus, inasmuch as he allowed that
lriendship, patriotism and similar virtues were good ln themselves. Dict.

Hence Cicero speaks οἱ Epicurus as eiusdem sere auctor adiutorque seu·
teutias (Diogen. Laert. 11 89). His sect became so completely out of date
(quibus obsoletis) aster Epicurus’ time, that no mention is male of them by
any succeeding writers, such as Ammonius, Alexander Aphrodisiensis
lamblichus, Proclus or Simplicius, except Clemens Alexandrinus.

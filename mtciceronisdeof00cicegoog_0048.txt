Introduction xli

this follows c. 3—c. 65 20 an illustration ol the truth that man
himself is the most useful os all things to men. We make men of
service to us (1) by benevolence and leat c. 7-85 30, (2) by ac·
quiring their esteem and confidence e. 85 31—c. 14, ( 3) by bene·
ficence and liberality c. 15-0. 24. 'The last chapter contains a
comparison of obligations in respectos their expediency. The
subject of the Third Book is the conflict of expediency and
moral rectitude. This book also contains a¹ special introduc·
tion on Cicero’s own position and his employment during 43
his forced retirement is compared with that of P. Africanus
(c. 2 5 6). The propriety os the question under discussion is
considered and the possibility of such 3 conflict proved (5 20),
and a general rule proposed sor the decision of particular
cases (5 21——c 8). The certainty also os being undetected
ought not to seduce us into doing wrong (c. 9). Then follow
examples shewing how a neglectos morality is occasioned

by friendship (5 43ff.) and political causes (c. 11), further on
examples of a confliet between justice and apparent expediency

(c 12-2 5), between courage and expediency (c. 26-32), and
lastly between temperance and expediency (c. 3 3).

The MSS. οἱ the de osticiis, which are'very numerous, pro-
ceed no doubt from one·source; this is shewn by the frequent
interpolations os whole narratives (1536) and a variety of
other corruptions common to all ol them Two separate re· 44
censions, however, may be recognized. At the head os the one ’
stands the Codex Bernensisc of the 13th (i) century, ol the
other the Codex Herbipolitanus or Wiirzburg, the Barn-
berg, the two Bernenses a and b, 311 of which probably belong
to the roth century, are the best. Bernensis c⁹⁰ has not so
many omissions as the other MSS. (e. g. 11549 etapudpopulum,

praelatorem) and in so many passages presents the only correct

eareat, tamen emendandi textus ciceroniani sons est uberrimus, siquidem

sive cum ipsum per se fidem meretur, plurimis locis omissa ab reliquis¹

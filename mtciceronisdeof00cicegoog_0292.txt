Posidonius] Ποσειδώνιος was a distinguished Stoic philosopher, born about
nc. 135, a pupil oi Panaetius. He was a native os Apamea in Syria, but
lived at Rhodes. Strabocalls him ἀνὴρ τῶν καθ’ ἡμᾶς φιλοσόφων noluero-
Otoraros: Cicero, who received instruction from him when he visited
Rhodes, de fin. r, 2, styles him vel omnium Stm'corum maximum (111 5 ro,
de nat. d. r 5 7, 5 123), and thought so highly of his powers that he
requested him to write an account of his consulship, as a most notable
philosopher, to visit whom Pompey, on his return from the Asiatic war,
went to Rhodes. He was a man of extensive and varied acquirements in
almost all departments of human knowledge, as a minute euquirer. He is
scarcely ever mentioned without some expression oi affection, and Cicero
tells us that he read his works more than those of any other author. At
a later period he became a resident at Rome and stayed in Cicero's house.
The fragments of his numerous writings were collected by J. Bake and
published at Leyden 1810. See Introd. 5 30.

CHAPTER VIII

ι’. ται. ². vorum tamen oet] the train of thought seems to be this 2-
‘uun tho’ Ι prefer exemplifying my remarks by the history of foreign states
than by that of our own, still we ourselves present an example to foreign

ι states of the fact, that power is better secured by love than fear.' “

l. 8. benenom tonabatur]=obtinebatur‚ ‘supported itself by
actions of gentleness.’ Sallust Catil. ch. 9 quod beneficiis quam nutu
imperium agitabant cl accepta iniuria agnoscere quom persequi malebant.
The sentence would have been more regular if the protasis quamdiu...tenc·
batur had had for its apodosis a sentence such as tamdiu respublica stabat.
But Cicero, carried away by his feelings on this subject, while expatiating
on the great evils arising from the altered course of policy, has one long pro·
tasis, to which there is no apodosis, till we come to ἓ 27 sensim lranc camue-
ludr'nem amisimus, and ἕ 29 alque in lras clades incidimus—dilcgi malumus.

1. θ. necessarll] i.e. no more than required by state policy, as in the
destruction of Carthage, Corinth, 1 ἕ 35.

populus properly refers to community of institutions‚ natio to community

of original language.

the relation os God to the world is ol importance for our hap-
piness and the right conduct of lif. On the other hand
Cicero had himself bestowed most thought on Ethics and
sought to form his own conclusions, although he had not
enough originality of genius to introduce any new theory, and
was deficient in the philosophical training necessary for the
production of a complete system. The negative character of
his convictions is seen especially in his rejection of the Epi-
curean doctrine ol Pleasure, while he wavers as if unable to
make up his mind between the Stoics and Peripatetics where
these two schools are notin accordanae. Setting aside those of 6
his minor writiugs which refer to ethics, as the deamicitia and
de sureautc, we can easily recognize the connexion which sub
sists between the rest Thus in the five books de finibus he
compares and discusses the opinions ol the three Greek schools,
the Epicurean, the Stoic and the Peripatetic, on the question
what is the supreme good-the fundamental principle ol prac-
tical wisdom-and thus lays the foundation sor future super-
structure. ln the Tusculanae disputationes he examines various ι
leading points of ethical philosophy, viz. such as belong to
Psychology, in the discussion of which he handles the dogmas
of the Stoic, Academic and other schools as an eclectic rather

affia'is are taken up with the paraenetic part ol ethics, the
precepts of practical philosophy, and are¹ thus connected with
the work infinibus. As to the commentan'us de uirtutibus, men-
tioned by Charisius 11 p. 200 ed. Keil¹¹, it is not known in
what relation it stood to the above books. 1t was, anyhow,
a supplementary treatise, but it seems to have been a collection
os dogmas rather than a work elaborated sor publication.
Cicero acknowledges himself a follower of the Academy as 7

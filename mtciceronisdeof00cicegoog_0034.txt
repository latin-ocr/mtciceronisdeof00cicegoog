not done with a perfect intention, are yet conformable to law
and reason, as μέσα καθήκοντα, medii efficta and placed thern
in contradistinction to the actions of the wisc man which are
the outcome of his perfect intention, and which they named
κατόρθωμα, perfectum offiu'um, ornuibus numerat absolutum, ‘com-
plete rectitude of action'. Externally‚ and judged by their
results, these two kinds of actions are perhaps allke, but
essentially they differ. The wise man works with all those
powers of a perfect soul, the union of which forms a beautiful
harmony3 the unwise man is impelled by external circum-
stances3 the wise man follows solely the inward impulse of
his noble nature which never allows him to go wrong, while
the other acts under a law, the application of which is some· ·
times uncertain. The actions of the wisc man are har·
moniously connected with each other, the other does what is
right by fits and starts and with interruptions. Since it isto
the intention alone that the Stoics attach any value‚ while the
separate actions in which it is shewn are indifferent to them,
the name κατόρθωμα may be given to every action of the wisc
man, should hedo no more than raise a finger. For he does
nothing in which heis not guided by, aud does not display, his
perfect intention. ,Ι
The same contrast between intermediate and perfect duties 21

was employed by the Stoics also in another way. The object
of duty is partly to realize virtue, partly to keep to such
things as are agreeable to nature and to avoid those which
are contrary to it. Accordingly they named the duties that
are directed to virtue καθήκοντα τέλεια or κατορθώματα, those
which are directed to external relations μέσα καθήκοντα, media

virtutibus suut neque in uitiis, est tamen quiddam, quod usui possit esse,
tollendum id nan est. Est autem eius generis actio quoque quaedam, et

ratim actum est, id officium appellamus: est igitur officiunt eius generis,
quod nec in boun ponatur nec in contrariis.

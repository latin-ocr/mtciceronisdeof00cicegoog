turning hirn round with a gentle blow on the cheek3 ...... the clenched fist

experience, requires to be brought out (explicari 5 81) by education and
training, to bring sorth that which is already latent in the mind. So Cicero
Top. 531 defines notia (toron, πρόληψις) to be insita et praecepta cuiusque
cognitio enodationis indigens.

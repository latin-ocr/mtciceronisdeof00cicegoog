1. 29. legam aaronem] an agrarian law was an enactment sor dividing
among the Plebs a certain portion ol the ager publicus or State Domain,
consisting of land taken by conquest [rom the enemy at various times.
Thus the lex Licinia, one of the earliest agrarian laws, proposed that no
one should occupy as tenant os the state (possideret) more than 500 jugera
os the public land, and that the remainder should be allotted as property
to the poorer classes. These agrarian laws related only to the public land,
occupied and rented by the patriciam, as possessores, and had nothing to do
with private property. This is a subject of great importance‚ and one
which has been much misunderstood. See Dici. Antiqq.‚ Art. ager publi·
eus, and lex agraria.

Introduction xxv⁴

the only evil is that which is morally bad. This identity of
the morally good and the expedient the Stoics expressed by
the axiom μόνον ἀγαθὰν τὰ καλόν, nihil honestum αι’ςὶ quod utile,
nihil utile nisi quod honestum. ’

The good man will take these outward possessions only for 17
what they are worth, he will despise all happiness or un-
happiness that proceeds from them (omnio humana contemnet),
and will not allow the impassive calm of his soul (ἀταραξία),
wherein consists what is rational, to be disturbed by them. He ¹
is therefore free from all passion, from sorrow, from excessive
joy, and no less from fear and repentance. He who possesses
this true virtue is pronounced by the Stoics to be the ‘Wise
Man' He is the perfect, the absolutely virtuous, happy and
independent man.

According to this definition of virtue, since the most perfect 18
state of mind is produced by an uninterrupted harmony with
reason, it is as impossible to imagine agradation of virtues,
as to possess one virtue isolated from the others. The virtue
of the Stoics is therefore no quality of the mind (ἕξις), which
each man may possess in a greater or less degree and improve
by practice, but a definite and unchangeable condition (διάθε-
σις τῆς ψυχῆς), which is as different from the condition of the
nonjvirtuous soul as a straight line is from a crooked one³⁹.
All wise men are equally virtuouS, equally happy, and there is
nothing midway between good and evil. This perfect state of
mind one can only have or not have, all unwise men therefore
are equally wicked and unhappy, slaves of their passions and
of outward circumstances; nothing is expedient to them, they
cando nothing right; and, as the Stoics further teach that
Mind alone has any worth, the mode and manner in which
it exercises itself is indifferent ; they considered all faults on a

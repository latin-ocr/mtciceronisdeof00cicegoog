x Proface

An army os commentators has at various times
been employed in explaining this which may perhaps
be called the most popular of Cicero's writings; Orelli
in his first edition of our author’s entire works Vol. Vl
p. 3 34 ff. enumerates more than 250 separate editions:
so that an editor has at his command a rich store of
materials. The editions on which I have chiefly levied
contributions are those of Heusinger, Zumpt, Beier and
Heine. (See p. xliii). Of the first his latest editor
Zumpt justly remarks⁷(ed. mai. praes. p. i) ‘communi

disciplinam refugias? The edition os Otto Heine, one

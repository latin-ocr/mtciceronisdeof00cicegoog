are not identical with those of circumstances,’ i.e. though, as a general rule,

relations and the like claim our assistance iu preference to any one else,

there may be circumstances in which those not bound to us by such ties

have a better claim. For c'ta=hac ratione, hac via, cp. 115 aol. 33, ’

1. 1⁷. necessitudinum] This word expresses some ‘bond of union‚'
‘tie’ formed by various circumstances, as by blood-relationship or affinity,
by belonging to the same collegium or society, by being colleagues in
office, by some services rendered, asin the case of intimate friends. Thus .
Cicero speaks of the necessitudo existing between himself and the Siciliane,
formed by his having been Quaestor in Sicily (Div. in Caec.) and of the
necessitudo sortc's between Verres and Caecilius, arising from the relation
they bore to each other as Praetor aud Quaestor. Necessitudo does
not differ from but is originally identical in meaning with necessitas,
‘exigencyl ‘straits’ being only the older form of the word: thus Sallust,
who affects the use of archaic forms, uses it in its pritnary sense Cat.
xvu ain unum omnis convocat, quibus maxima necessitudo et plu·
simum audactae inerant. See Kritz od l. and comp. Tacitus Ann. 111 64.
Still there is a difference in usage, thus defined by the ancient gram·
marians, viz. that necessitas means ‘the actual constraint imposed,’ neces·
situdo, ‘the condition of a person in such a coustraint.' Walther has a
good note on this distinction in his edition of Tacitus Aun. 1 9.

pression is unusual, and its genuineness has been doubted, but it is vindi·
cated by Burmann on Ovid Art. Am. 11 346, and Ernesti who in his Clanis
s. v. compares Cic. Phil. 1115 29 patrium arcimum virtutemque cupiamus,

1. aa boni rauoanatores] ‘accurate calculators,’ i.e. iu striking a
balance of claims and obligations, so as to know how much is due to
each. The Stoics considered this εὐλογιστία as a special virtue: Stobaeus

τικὴν τῶν γιγνομένων καὶ ἀποτελουμένων.

tas. formulas] ‘established iorms’ ol l procedure, under some
one of which every action at law must be broug t as in our law under the
head (formula) ol felony, larceny, arson, misdemeanour, &c

Upon the suppression oi certain sacramental forms called tegis actiones
‘actions oi therlaw' by the lex Aebutia about nc. ooo by reason oi the
excessive nicety oi their technicalities the formulary system took their

was remitted to the iudex to regulate his decrsion (in indicio). All the
formulae generally in use were to be found in thealdum Praetoris, and
they were multiplied from time to time to suit the exigencies ol particular
cases. The three parts of the formula were (ι) the demonstratio,
(statement of facts, and ground os action), (a) intentio (Plaintifl's claim,
and the question ior the decision ol the iudex, and which might be
modified with the words quantum aequius melius sit, or en fide aaa,
binding the index to take the whole circumstances into equitable considera·
tion), (3) condemnatio, which gave the iudex power to condemn or aequit
the defendant, and which was usually qualified with a taxatio, restrictrng
the amount of damages to be awarded by the iudex to a certain maximum,
or adiudicatio, giving the iudex or arbiter power to adjudicate. We have
the text oi a formula given by Gaius (4, 47), in a case where Aulus Agerius
sued Numerius Negidius sor restoration of a silver table deposited with him
and, sailing restitution, sor payment ol damages :—

Octavius iudex esto; Quod Aulus Agerius apud Numerium
Nigidium mensam'argenteam deposuit ; qna de re agitur; -

Quidquid ob eam rem N. Negidium A. Agerio darc facere
oportet enfide bona eins ;

iudex N. Negidium A. Agerio condemnato, nisi restituam
si non paret, absolvito.

When the parties had appeared in court, the plaintifl declared his form ol
action (editio actionis), and applied to the magistrate sor a formula
(actionis postulatio). The magistrate or praetor appointed a index lor the
trial of the case, and delivered to him a formula determining the question
to be decided. The delivery ol the formula cum iudicium accipitur was
the moment of the litis contestatio, which ended the proceedings in iure.
Such formulae were those ol Aquilius de dolo atala sor the guidance of
the iudex in a claim lor restitution, where a fraud had been practised in a
sale or some similar proceeding. The formulary system remained in
force until the reign os Diocledan, Α. n. 294. See Lord Mackenzie Studies

enemies with a friendly eye, or preserve any such sentiments sor them, as
the Roman orator would ascribe to his ancestors Not to mention that the
early Romans really exercised piracy, as we learn from their first treatics

and Algerine tovers, were actually at war with most natious, and a stranger
and an enemy were with them almost synonymous‘ Donaldson (Varroni-

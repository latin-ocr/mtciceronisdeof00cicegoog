1.1o. Demetrius Phalereus] Demetrius ὀΦαληρεύς, so called from
his birthplace, the Attic δῆμος, where he was born about rac. 345.
He was educated, together with the poet Menander, in the School os
Theophrastus He began his public career about ne. 325, and soon
acquired a great name by his public speaking. As he acted thoroughly
in the spirit of Phocion he was made governor of Athens by Cassander
rac. 317, au offioe which he filled for ten years (Atheniensium remp.
exsanguem iam et eacmtem sustentavit Cic. de rep. 11 5 a). Afterwards,
becoming intoxicated with his extraordinary good fortune, he abandoned
himself to every kind of dissipation, which roused a party of malcontents,
so that on the approach of Demetrius Poliorcetes to Athens he fied to
Thebes and thence to the court of Ptolemy Lagi at Alexandria, where he
devoted himself to literary pursuits (Plutarch, de exil. p. 602 F), and died
rac. ²83· His numerous writings (a list of which is given by Diogenes
Laertius v 80) embraced subjects of the most varied kinds 3 he was the
last among the Attio orators worthyof the name (Cic. Brut 8, Quintil. x

by force and sublimity. Cicero, Brut. rx 5 37, says of him z Phalereussnc·

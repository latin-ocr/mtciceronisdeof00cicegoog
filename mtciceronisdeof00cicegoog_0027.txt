xx Introduction

11 suited his purpose⁸⁴. In the philosophy os the Stoics he found
the doctrine of duhes carried into detail: their system more
than any other represented man as independent os external
circumstances, and it appeared to him nobler and greater to

say with the Stoies that the morally good is alone and at all
times expedient, than to maintain with others that there are

virtuous ¹actions which are not expedient, and expedient which
are immoral³⁸. Notwithstanding he cannot accept all their
conclusions. Much is uncouth and offends against good man·
ners and natural feeling, by which he is guided more than
by philosophie conviction. The refined Roman has a great
horror of all cynical rudeness, from which the Stoies are not
wholly exempt³⁰. The notion also that the wisc man may be
happy under pain and ought to be wholly independent os ex·
ternal circumstances, while it seems to him sublime, is too
much opposed to his own instinctive feeling not to admit os
some concession to the Peripatetics⁸⁷. Above all he regards
as absurd the Stoic paradox, that all unwise men-and such
all men are, properly speaking, according to the Stoics——are
unwise, all bad men bad, in an equal degree, all foolish men
equally soolish⁸⁸, that, short os the standard os perfectiori, all
saults and vices are of equal magnitude: the first os these
dogmas he ignores in the dc (stiriis, and os wrongs hesays that
those done from thoughtlessness are less criminal than such as
are willel and premeditated³⁹. He commends highly the pre·
serence whieh they assign to a lise os practical activity over one
of philosophical contemplationt. The Stoics say that a wise
man should at least take some part in the state, where an
inclination to progress manifests itsell: so Cicero calls it
cowardice and neglect of duty to their country, if those who
have the ability do not devote themselves zealously to the
public service⁴¹.
